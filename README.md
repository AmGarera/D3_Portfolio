# D3_Portfolio

- A portfolio of all my work done in CIS493 compiled into a Bootstrap themed directory as the final project
- All examples can be a good use of Example Snippets to get started using [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- Examples Screenshots can been seen below and all you have to do is clone or fork and open it up in your choice of IDE or editor and start messing with it no complex setup!
